# Micro-Hunt Execution Decisions

Running log of Team Lead judgment calls during `/execute-plan`. See
`.claude/skills/execute-plan/references/decisions-template.md` for format.

## Reviewer selection

**When**: Step 2
**Decision**: Use `ui-quality-reviewer`, `design-reviewer`, and `react-reviewer`. Skip `wireframe-reviewer`.
**Why**: No `wireframe.html` exists in `artifacts/micro-hunt/`, so wireframe-vs-impl comparison is not applicable. The plan has heavy UI work (Tasks 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11) composed of shadcn components inside React Server Components + client islands, so the other three reviewers all apply.
**Harness Signal**: N/A — the rule in `SKILL.md` Step 2 already captures this ("when wireframe.html exists" / "when UI present" / "when UI components present" / "when React/Next.js present").
**Result**: Pending

## Task execution order

**When**: Step 3
**Decision**: Execute in plan.md order — `1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8a → 8b → 9 → 10 → 11 → 12`.
**Why**: plan.md already encodes dependencies in the "Dependencies" field per Task, and the sequence honors them:
- Tasks 1–3 build DB schema bottom-up (cohorts → projects → votes).
- Task 4 (storage bucket) has no hard deps on 1–3 but belongs in the "infrastructure" group before any UI consumer.
- Tasks 5–11 depend on 1–4 and on each other (5 → 6 → 7 → 8a → 9 → 10 → 11, with 8b parallel to 9+).
- Task 12 depends on 5–11.
No reordering was needed; the plan's ordering is already dependency-correct.
**Harness Signal**: N/A — plan.md's explicit per-Task "Dependencies" field made ordering derivable without guesswork.
**Result**: Pending

## Task 1: accepted pre-existing drift on `handle_new_user` / `on_auth_user_created`

**When**: Step 4, Task 1, `supabase db diff` verification
**Decision**: Strip the auto-generated drop statements for `public.handle_new_user()` and the `on_auth_user_created` trigger from the generated migration, and ignore them in the post-migration drift check.
**Why**: Per `.claude/rules/supabase-migration.md`, triggers and trigger functions live exclusively in manual migrations. The declarative diff tool cannot represent them, so it always emits drops when regenerating schema. This drift exists independently of Task 1's changes and was present in the repo before I started. Leaving the drops in the migration would break profile auto-creation on new signups.
**Harness Signal**: The `supabase` skill could add a "Expected residual drift" note explaining that projects using the trigger-via-migration pattern will always show `drop function`/`drop trigger` lines in `supabase db diff`, and that the fix is to delete those lines from the generated migration (never hand-modify the manual trigger migration itself).
**Result**: Success — tests pass, `bun run build` green, trigger still wired on reset.

## Task 1: anon vs authenticated access to profile author names

**When**: Step 4, Task 1, RLS design
**Decision**: Broaden `profiles` SELECT to `authenticated` (all rows), leave anon with no direct profile access. Defer the anon-sees-author-name requirement to Task 2 via the `projects_with_vote_count` view's `security_invoker` setting.
**Why**: spec.md Scenario 1 says anon visitors see cards that include `author display_name`, but plan.md Task 1 explicitly scopes the broader SELECT policy to `authenticated` only, and plan.md Task 2 says the view should be `security_invoker = true`. These two statements conflict for anon readers. Deferring resolution to Task 2 keeps the Task 1 change surface minimal and lets the view be tuned there (e.g. joining via a narrow public-projection view or switching to `security_invoker = false` scoped to the display-only columns).
**Harness Signal**: `draft-plan` could check spec Scenarios marked "any visitor" against plan.md RLS decisions and flag any authenticated-only policies on entities that anon needs to read through a view. A "public reachability" cross-check would catch this before execution.
**Result**: Pending — resolution belongs to Task 2.

## Moved `projects_with_vote_count` view from Task 2 into Task 3

**When**: Step 4, Task 2 start
**Decision**: Create `public.projects` table in Task 2 but defer the `projects_with_vote_count` view to Task 3 (after the `votes` table exists).
**Why**: plan.md Task 2 asks for the view inline in `supabase/schemas/projects.sql`, but the view performs `LEFT JOIN public.votes` — that table is introduced in Task 3. Declaring the view in Task 2 would fail at `supabase db reset`. Moving the view into Task 3 keeps each Task's migration self-applicable and preserves the "vote_count = 0 when no votes exist" acceptance test at its natural location.
**Harness Signal**: `draft-plan` could check that SQL views/functions declared in a Task only reference tables from the same or earlier Task — a simple dependency sort on SQL objects would catch this before execution.
**Result**: Success — view created in Task 3 as `supabase/schemas/projects_with_vote_count.sql`; anon-read via the view verified in `votes_test.sql`.

## Task 3: `projects_with_vote_count` uses `security_invoker = false`, not `true`

**When**: Step 4, Task 3, view design
**Decision**: Define `projects_with_vote_count` with `security_invoker = false` (definer semantics, the Postgres default) instead of plan.md's specified `security_invoker = true`. Only project display-safe profile columns (`display_name`, `avatar_url`) through the view; keep `profiles` itself authenticated-only.
**Why**: spec.md Scenario 1 requires anon visitors to see `author display_name` on cards. With `security_invoker = true`, an anon query on the view would evaluate underlying `profiles` RLS as anon and see zero rows — author names would disappear. `security_invoker = false` lets the view project a narrowly chosen set of profile columns as a controlled public surface, while `profiles` retains its authenticated-only RLS (so PII like `email` and `full_name` stays gated). Writes go directly to base tables, not the view, so owner-only RLS on `projects`/`votes` is unaffected.
**Harness Signal**: `draft-plan` could check that any view flagged as publicly readable is consistent with its base-table RLS: if the base table isn't readable by the same role as the view's intended audience, either (a) broaden the base table's RLS, (b) drop `security_invoker = true`, or (c) route through a column-filtered intermediate view. The plan skill could prompt to resolve this up front.
**Result**: Success — pgTAP asserts anon-read via the view; base-table RLS still gates direct access.

## Task 3: explicit `schema_paths` order in `supabase/config.toml`

**When**: Step 4, Task 3, diff tool failed with "relation public.votes does not exist"
**Decision**: Replace the glob `schema_paths = ["./schemas/*.sql"]` with an explicit list that orders `votes.sql` before `projects_with_vote_count.sql`.
**Why**: Alphabetical sort put `projects_with_vote_count.sql` before `votes.sql`, so the diff tool tried to create a view referencing a table that hadn't been created yet. An explicit order encodes the real dependency. The default glob is safe for single-table schemas but breaks as soon as views (or functions, triggers) reference later-sorting names.
**Harness Signal**: The `supabase` skill could recommend declaring explicit `schema_paths` whenever a schema defines a view or function that references another schema file, rather than relying on glob order.
**Result**: Success — `supabase db reset` + `supabase test db` both pass.
